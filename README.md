# A Note

This repo previously contained the source code and readme for THavalon, which was my extended ruleset for The Resistance: Avalon. This project has been taken off of Github while the mechanics are refined further. Feel free to contact me (aquadrizzt@gmail.com) for the latest version, but beware that the last version had several major mechanical imbalances that have not been addressed yet. 

Thanks,

Aqua

# What is THavalon
THavalon is a massive extension of the rules presented in Don Eskridge's social deception game, The Resistance: Avalon. The main point of THavalon is to provide every player of the game with a role and that to ensure every player in the game feels like they can make an impact on the result of the game. Over time, these rules have evolved in an effort to make the game both faster and more fun, as well as to fix some of the playstyles that have been established in my main testing group's metagame.
